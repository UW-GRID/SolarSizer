## Welcome to the data directory!

There are two categories of data within this directory:
1. Load profiles
2. Irradiance data

The load profile will be saved after the user inputs a csv file within the GUI. We have provided an example of a load profile named load_profile_example.csv

The irradiance data will be created after the user inputs a desired latitufe and longitude. The API fetches solar irradiance data from the nrel NSRDB database.
